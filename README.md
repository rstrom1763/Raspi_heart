Raspi_heart

This is a project that allows a Raspberry Pi with a sense hat to be set to display a rainbow heart. Generally speaking this was intended for couples doing long distance, however if other applications are found, that is fine too. 

This project is very much in progress. There is a lot to do. Long term plan is for there to be an IOS app that can be used to toggle the status of the heart as well as set it to display text based messages instead of the standard rainbow heart. 

If you would like to contribute to this project feel free! I utilize the issues on this repo to track all of my plans and progress on things. If you have additional ideas feel free to create an issue!
